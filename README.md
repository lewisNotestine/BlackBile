BlackBile
=========


A simple event-logging application in development for Android that can be used from your lock screen.
Ever wonder how often all of life’s little annoyances happen? 

<ul>
<li>Your smarty-pants professor using the same phrase, incorrectly, AGAIN?</li>
<li>Your boss smacking his lips when eating lunch, spitting out food while making sexist jokes AGAIN?</li>
<li>Your husband promising to do something while sitting on the couch in jammies eating potato chips AGAIN?</li>
<li>Your child picking his nose in public AGAIN?</li>
</ul>

With BlackBile, you don’t have to wonder how many of life's slings and arrows you have been suffering. You’ll be able to show and tell day-by-day, hour-by-hour exactly what you’ve been putting up with. 

*Share Your Misery*

With BlackBile, you can configure detailed reports that you can post to Facebook or your Twitter feed.  Or, if you prefer to suffer in silence,  you can configure BlackBile to hide your pain (or, as much of it as you want to hide).  BlackBile does not collect your personal data or store it on a server. Your woes are your own, and BlackBile respects that.

*Know Your Misery*

With statistical predictive analysis built in, BlackBile is smart.  With enough data, BlackBile can make predictions about exactly what is going to go wrong every day.  

*Note* 

BlackBile is for amusement only.
